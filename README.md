From Wikipedia:

> In computing, a benchmark is the act of running a computer program, a set of programs, or other operations, in order to assess the relative performance of an object, normally by running a number of standard tests and trials against it.

## Programming Languages

* [The Computer Language Benchmarks Game](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/) Website that shows toy-program performance measurements for ~24 language implementations.
* [PyBench](https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/pybench) This test profile evaluates Python's average performance on a system. It measures the total time taken by various average timed test results, including functions like BuiltinFunctionCalls and NestedForLoops. The total time offers an approximate idea of Python's overall performance on the system.
* [SPECjbb 2015](http://www.spec.org/jbb2015/) The SPECjbbÂ® 2015 benchmark has been developed from the ground up to measure performance based on the latest Java application features. It is relevant to all audiences who are interested in Java server performance.
* [Archived] [arewefastyet](https://github.com/mozilla/arewefastyet) a set of tools used for benchmarking the major browser's JavaScript virtual machines against each other, as well as reporting the results on a website as insightful graphs showing the evolution of performance over time.

## Browser

* [Firefox's performance dashboard](https://github.com/mozilla-frontend-infra/firefox-performance-dashboards)
  AreWeFastYet tracks various Firefox performance benchmarks. AreWeSlimYet tracks various Firefox memory metrics.

## HTTP Server

* [awesome-http-benchmark](https://github.com/denji/awesome-http-benchmark) HTTP(S) benchmark tools, testing/debugging, & restAPI (RESTful)

## Platform & Tools

* [OpenBenchmarking.org](https://openbenchmarking.org/) Effective collaboration tools for sharing results and efficiently comparing multiple test results and other analytical features.

## *Tests*

* [Test262 Report](https://test262.report/) is a tool for people who write JavaScript programs for web browsers and node.js to learn about implementation interoperability. This report is backed by comprehensive specification-conformance tests. This data-driven approach to interoperability reporting sets Test262 Report apart from traditional compatibility tables.
